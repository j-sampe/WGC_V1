# WGC_V1
Write Great Code Volume 1 Second Edition by Randall Hyde (Code and Notes)

Some book notes.

- Why low-level ?
  You can't write efficent code without know this.
- To write great code, you need to know how to write efficient code
  Understand how computer execute programs helps you to know how abstrations works.
- About learning Assembly Language.
  The real benefits of learning ASM is to understand how the *machine organization component works.
- Study Advance compueter architecture. Why not ?

- Machine Organization.

"Is a subset of computer architecture, low-level data typer, internal CPU onganition, memory organization and access, low level machine operations and how computer comunicate."

- Characteristics of Great Code (WGC_V1):

    Uses CPU efficiently (is fast).
    Uses memory effciently (is samll).
    Uses system resource efficiently.
    Is ESAY TO READ and maintain.
    Follows style guiedelines.
    Uses a stablished design.
    Esasy to enchance.
    Tested and robust (Always works).
    Well documented.

Randal Hyde definition of Great Code:

"Is written using a consistent and prioritized set of good software charecteristics, follows a ser of rules when implementin a algorithm as source code"

- NUMERIC REPRESENTATION.
  Write Great Code requires understan how compueters represent numbers.

  Understand the difference between a number and the representation of that number.

  A number is an intangible, abastrac concept use to denote quantity.

- NUMBERING SYSTEMS.
  The Decimal Positional Numbering System.
